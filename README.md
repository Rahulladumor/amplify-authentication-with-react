# amplify-authentication-with-react


## Basic Setup
First, if you don’t have Node yet, download and install it. <br />

Open https://nodejs.org/en/download

### You will also need an AWS account to run Amplify. Create your AWS account if you don’t have one yet.

# Amplify
Now, with the basic setup completed, let’s begin.

## Install the Amplify CLI
The Amplify Command Line Interface (CLI) is a unified toolchain to create, integrate, and manage the AWS cloud services for your app.

### `$ sudo npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli`

## Configure Amplify 
SignIn to your aws account and run:

### `$ sudo npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli`

Press Enter, Specify the Aws region, username, and Enter again.
  `amplify configure`<br />
`Scanning for plugins...`<br />
`Plugin scan successful`<br />
Follow these steps to set up access to your AWS account:
Sign in to your AWS administrator account:
https://console.aws.amazon.com/<br />


    Press Enter to continue
    Specify the AWS Region
    ? region: eu-west-2
    Specify the username of the new IAM user:
    ? user name: amplify-user
    
    
Complete the user creation using the AWS console<br />
https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=undefined#/users$new?step=final&accessKey&userNames=amplify-7T7mt&permissionType=policies&policies=arn:aws:iam::aws:policy%2FAdministratorAccess
Press Enter to continue

##Complete the AWS Amplify user creation, download the credentials, and add the remaining information in the terminal:

Scanning for plugins...

Plugin scan successful

Follow these steps to set up access to your AWS account:

    Sign in to your AWS administrator account:

      https://console.aws.amazon.com/

    Press Enter to continue

    Specify the AWS Region region : eu-west-2

    Specify the username of the new IAM user:
    
    user name: amplify-user

 Complete the user creation
 
  using the AWS console https : / / console. aws . amazon. com/iam/home? reg ion—undef ined#/ use ina l&accessF ey&use rn : aws : iam : : aws : policy%2F AdministratorAccess 
  
  Press Enter to continue
  
    Enter the access key of the newly created user:
   
    secretAccessKey :

This would update/create the AWS Profile in your local machine Profile Name: amplify Successfully set up the new user.


# Configure your React app
Let’s install AWS Amplify packages in our React app:
    $ sudo npm install aws-amplify @aws-amplify/ui-react

# Authentication
Let’s proceed and add authentication to the app.

Authentication in Amplify uses Amazon Cognito.
    $ amplify add auth
Make the selections below or according to your config:

    Do you want to use the default authentication and security configuration? Defailt configuration
    How do you want to be able to sign in ? Email
    Do you want to configure advanced setting? NO, I am done
   
   
 This command will walk us through a series of questions. Each question is configuring the authentication for our application.
If you are unsure what configuration you need, go ahead and select Yes, use the default configuration for the first question. You can always come back and reconfigure these settings by running the command amplify update auth.
We now have the authentication module configured for our application. But, we still need to deploy this configuration to our AWS account. Lucky for us, this is handled by the Amplify CLI as well.
Let’s push the configuration to the cloud with the command below:

    $ amplify push
 
 
 Are you sure want to continue ? YES
 
 This will create and deploy the necessary changes to our AWS account to support our authentication module. A configuration file called aws-exports.js will be copied to your configured source directory, for example ./src.
 
 Configure Amplify in the React app
Now, let’s add the Amplify auth service to our React app.
Open your favorite IDE and edit the index.js file:
 
        import React from 'react';
        import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
        import './index.css';
        import App from './App';
        import * as serviceWorker from './serviceWorker';
        import Amplify from 'aws-amplify';
        import awsconfig from './aws-exports';

        Amplify.configure(awsconfig);

        ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
        serviceWorker.unregister();

    Next, add the Amplify Authenticator to your App.js file:
        import React from "react";
    import "./App.css";
    import { withAuthenticator, AmplifySignOut } from "@aws-amplify/ui-react";

    function App() {
      return (
        <div>
          <AmplifySignOut />
          My App
        </div>
      );
    }

    export default withAuthenticator(App, true);
    
Now, we are ready to test the app.
Run the application using:
    $npm run start
Your browser will load with a secure page to sign in. Your app is now protected with Amplify.
